# 🎮 TIC-TAC-TOE  

**HTML | CSS | JavaScript**  

A simple yet addictive game — with *dark theme supremacy* 🌚✨  

---  

### **📝 Notes**  

- 🔴 **Red** plays as `'X'`  
- 🔵 **Blue** plays as `'O'`  
- 🚫 **Online multiplayer** not supported yet - sorry {{(>~<)}}

- ♻ **Buttons**:  
  - `New Game`: Resets the board **and** all statistics.  
  - `Reset Game`: Clears the board *without* resetting stats.

### **🎨 Theme Philosophy**  

> *The game is dark-themed because light attracts bugs*  
> *(Not funny? Fine. `throw new HumorError(404);`)* 😂
